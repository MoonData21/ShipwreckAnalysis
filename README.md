# ShipwreckAnalysis

INTRODUCTION:
Problem Statement: Reviewing the Titanic and the Estonia Datasets
This project explores survival patterns from two of the most well-known maritime disasters — the Titanic and the Estonia — through data analysis and visualization. Using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, I examined and compared demographic and survival data to uncover insights into the human and social factors behind each tragedy.

Tools: Jupyter Notebook | Pandas | Matplotlib

Key Objectives:

Compare the overall severity of the two shipwrecks using survival-related metrics.

Analyze survival rates by age, gender, and role (passenger vs. crew).

Determine which ship offered a greater chance of survival.

Investigate whether wealth and class influenced survival on the Titanic.

Examine the truth behind the “women and children first” principle.

Explore survival rates among elderly passengers, broken down by gender.

This project demonstrates my ability to perform data wrangling, aggregation, and exploratory analysis in Python while visualizing real-world historical data to answer complex questions.
