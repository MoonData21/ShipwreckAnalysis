The project was completed with a Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

INTRODUCTION:
Problem Statement: Reviewing the Titanic and the Estonia Datasets
The main objective of this project is to examine both the datasets provided for the Titanic and the Estonia, and determine the following questions:

QUESTIONS to be Analyzed:

Which crash was considered to be worse based factors that will be determined in the analysis.
What was the mean age and gender for survival and death.
Which ship had a better survival rate (broken down by passengers, crew, and both passengers & crew together).
I will examine my survival rate for each ship, and determine which ship I had a greater chance of survival.
Did the wealthier passengers on the Titanic have a better chance of survival than the regular passengers and the crew members?
Was it true that the women and children took priority for the lifeboats?
What was the breakdown of the elderly by gender that survived?
